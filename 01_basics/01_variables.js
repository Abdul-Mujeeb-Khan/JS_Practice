/*
When you declare a variable in JavaScript without using var, let, or const, 
it is implicitly created as a global variable (if itâ€™s not in strict mode). 
This means it becomes a property of the global object (like window in browsers).
*/

/*
In strict mode, attempting to use an undeclared variable will throw a ReferenceError,
 preventing accidental global variable creation. Always strive for explicit declarations to avoid issues!
